        help
          Frame composition driver using OMAP DSS2.  Allows using all
	  DSS2 resources in a unified configuration.  Should not be used
	  together with other DSS2 devices, such as V4L2 or framebuffer.

	help
	  Takes timestamp for each callback and state transition, and
	  logs the last 128 entries (last few frames' worth) in a
	  log buffer.  This is a separate menuconfig in case this is
	  deemed an overhead.

	bool "ISP resizer used  for 720p video in DSSCOMP in OMAP3 (EXPERIMENTAL)"

	default n
	help
	  Use ISP resizer on video buffers instead of DSS resizer.
	  Could increase performance of playing 720p clip but,
	  have some issues when record 720p with camera.
