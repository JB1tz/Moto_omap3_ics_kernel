/*
 * Immediate Value - x86 architecture specific code.
 *
 * Rationale
 *
 * Required because of :
 * - Erratum 49 fix for Intel PIII.
 * - Still present on newer processors : Intel Core 2 Duo Processor for Intel
 *   Centrino Duo Processor Technology Specification Update, AH33.
 *   Unsynchronized Cross-Modifying Code Operations Can Cause Unexpected
 *   Instruction Execution Results.
 *
 * Quoting "Intel Core 2 Duo Processor for IntelCentrino Duo Processor
 * Technology Specification Update" (AH33)
 *
 * "The act of one processor, or system bus master, writing data into a
 * currently executing code segment of a second processor with the intent of
 * having the second processor execute that data as code is called
 * cross-modifying code (XMC). XMC that does not force the second processor to
 * execute a synchronizing instruction, prior to execution of the new code, is
 * called unsynchronized XMC. Software using unsynchronized XMC to modify the
 * instruction byte stream of a processor can see unexpected or unpredictable
 * execution behavior from the processor that is executing the modified code."
 *
 * This code turns what would otherwise be an unsynchronized XMC into a
 * synchronized XMC by making sure a synchronizing instruction (either iret
 * returning from the breakpoint or cpuid from sync_core()) is executed by any
 * CPU before it executes the modified instruction.
 *
 * Reentrant for NMI and trap handler instrumentation. Permits XMC to a
 * location that has preemption enabled because it involves no temporary or
 * reused data structure.
 *
 * Quoting Richard J Moore, source of the information motivating this
 * implementation which differs from the one proposed by Intel which is not
 * suitable for kernel context (does not support NMI and would require disabling
 * interrupts on every CPU for a long period) :
 *
 * "There is another issue to consider when looking into using probes other
 * then int3:
 *
 * Intel erratum 54 - Unsynchronized Cross-modifying code - refers to the
 * practice of modifying code on one processor where another has prefetched
 * the unmodified version of the code. Intel states that unpredictable general
 * protection faults may result if a synchronizing instruction (iret, int,
 * int3, cpuid, etc ) is not executed on the second processor before it
 * executes the pre-fetched out-of-date copy of the instruction.
 *
 * When we became aware of this I had a long discussion with Intel's
 * microarchitecture guys. It turns out that the reason for this erratum
 * (which incidentally Intel does not intend to fix) is because the trace
 * cache - the stream of micro-ops resulting from instruction interpretation -
 * cannot be guaranteed to be valid. Reading between the lines I assume this
 * issue arises because of optimization done in the trace cache, where it is
 * no longer possible to identify the original instruction boundaries. If the
 * CPU discoverers that the trace cache has been invalidated because of
 * unsynchronized cross-modification then instruction execution will be
 * aborted with a GPF. Further discussion with Intel revealed that replacing
 * the first opcode byte with an int3 would not be subject to this erratum.
 *
 * So, is cmpxchg reliable? One has to guarantee more than mere atomicity."
 *
 * Overall design
 *
 * The algorithm proposed by Intel applies not so well in kernel context: it
 * would imply disabling interrupts and looping on every CPUs while modifying
 * the code and would not support instrumentation of code called from interrupt
 * sources that cannot be disabled.
 *
 * Therefore, we use a different algorithm to respect Intel's erratum (see the
 * quoted discussion above). We make sure that no CPU sees an out-of-date copy
 * of a pre-fetched instruction by 1 - using a breakpoint, which skips the
 * instruction that is going to be modified, 2 - issuing an IPI to every CPU to
 * execute a sync_core(), to make sure that even when the breakpoint is removed,
 * no cpu could possibly still have the out-of-date copy of the instruction,
 * modify the now unused 2nd byte of the instruction, and then put back the
 * original 1st byte of the instruction.
 *
 * It has exactly the same intent as the algorithm proposed by Intel, but
 * it has less side-effects, scales better and supports NMI, SMI and MCE.
