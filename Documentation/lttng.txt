Linux Text Toolkit Next Generation
Mathieu Desnoyers, July 2009

This guide contains quickstart information on how to to use LTTng. It currently
only contains information about ascii text dump, but (TODO) we should bring the
LTTng manual here.

 * Quick and dirty startup ascii output script:

#!/bin/sh

LTT_DIR=/mnt/debugfs/ltt
ltt-armall
echo trace > ${LTT_DIR}/setup_trace
cd control/
cd trace/
echo relay > ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/trans
cd channel/
for a in ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/channel/*/switch_timer;
	do echo 100 > $a; done
#note: error for metadata channel for the following line is OK
#it is not permitted to set metadata channel in overwrite mode
for a in ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/channel/*/overwrite;
	do echo 1 > $a; done
for a in ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/channel/*/enable;
	do echo 1 > $a; done
cd ..
echo 1 > ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/alloc
echo 1 > ${LTT_DIR}/control/trace/enabled

To see the events for a given channel (e.g. kernel events):

cat ${LTT_DIR}/ascii/trace/kernel
(hit CTRL-C to stop)
